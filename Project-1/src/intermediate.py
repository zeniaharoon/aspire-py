    This test you are going to learn about errors and exception handling

    Consider the following:

    Often times in code, our program will crash because we didnt make it robust
    We saw in basic.py that it was fairly easy to ensure simple things like
    enforcing a parameter to be an integer. But what about other cases where
    that doesnt work?

    For another case, maybe we know and expect our code to fail in a certain location.
    Given that we know this information, we maybe want to do some specific actions before 
    our program quits, or even let it continue on!

    This is where try-except blocks come into play. If you need an example of how these work,
    feel free to browse the evaluation section at the bottom of this file (No modifications though)
    ===============================================================================================
    How to complete:

    This function will take in 6 parameters representing fundamental data types/structures:
    integer,
    float,
    string,
    boolean,
    list,
    dictionary
     
    I have implemented some code below that you are not to modify.

    Create a try-except block around that code to handle the errors that will arise.

    - When i try adding mismatched types, return the string "apple"
    - Division by zero returns "banana"
    - Attribute errors return "corn"
    - Index out of range returns "donut"
    - Key errors return "eggplant"

class Avenger:
    """
    This is a class, we use this to group data together into structures that make semantic sense
    Take note on a few things:
        - The syntax for this particular class takes no arguments, unlike a function
        - The naming convention for classes is CapCase, always a capital letter to start each word
        - In computer science, we generally refer to classes as "objects"
            - In python, technically everything is an "object"

    Test 1:
    We are going to code an Avengers video game...
    Write a constructor for the Avenger class that aligns to following documentation below:

    NOTE:   For all bounded values, if the number passed in is above a boundary, set it to the max.
            if the number passed is below a boundary set it to min.
            Special exception for health, if it is below 0, automatically set to 100
            ex: if between 0-1, and number passed 30, set to 1

    Parameters:
    self:                           Reference to the object itself
    name:               (String)    The superhero name
    secret_identity:    (String)    The true identity
    health:             (Float)     (Non-negative) The amount of health this hero has to begin with
    power:              (Float)     (Between 0-1) How powerful this character is
    agility:            (Float)     (Between 0-1) How fast the character can move (dodge attacks)
    level:              (int)       (Non-negative) Level progression, should initialize to 1
                                    SPECIFY A DEFAULT VALUE = 1 FOR THIS PARAMETER ^

    Member Fields:
    name:               (String)    The superhero name
    secret_identity:    (String)    The true identity
    health:             (Float)     (Non-negative) The amount of health this hero has to begin with
    power:              (Float)     (Between 0-1) How powerful this character is
    agility:            (Float)     (Between 0-1) How fast the character can move (dodge attacks)
    level:              (int)       (Non-negative) Level progression, should initialize to 1
    exp:                (int)       (Between 0-100) Experience points, initialize to 0

    """
    attacked()

    Should take in a parameter that will inflict damage, decreasing overall health
    However...
    Depending on the agility member field, there will be an agility% change that the attack misses
    and does no damage. HINT: use the numpy package and its random number capabilities...

    If the damage dealt is greater than the health remaining, the health should be zero
    Health should never be negative!

    Parameters:
    self
    damage

    Returns:
    dead      (boolean)   True if health below zero, else False
    """

    #TODO: Add functionality here
    """
    restore_health()

    Should take one parameter that will restore health to max value

    You will need to add another member field to the Avenger class
    to keep track of the max health originally set such that you cannot go over it

    ex: iron_man initialized with 100 health and then takes 20 damage. If 
    restore_health(50) is called, iron_man should be at 100 health not 130

    Parameters:
    self,
    restoration

    Returns:
    None

    #TODO: Add functionality here

    Takes no parameters, simply resets health back to max health

    Nothing

    Returns:
    None

    special_power()

    This will be what known as an "abstract method"

    For the avenger class, we will not actually write any running code in the body of this method
    it will be used later for inheritence

    When this method is called directly, it should "raise" a "NotImplementedError"
