## Assignment
We learned a lot in project-0, lets refresh some of those concepts and review basic and advanced python programming. Here's how to complete this project:
### Review
- âœ… `merge`/Sync your forked repo with main (if there are changes)
- âœ… Using `git`, go `fetch` updates on your terminal to view changes. If there are changes, `pull` them down
- âœ… Using terminal navigate to the `Project-1` directory and create a file called `results.py`
- âœ… `vim` into `results.py`, and add a `header`. Put your name, date, and a description of the program in a multiline comment at the top of the file. Example:
    - ```python
        """
        Author: Brian Zhu

        Date: 7/4/23 ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

        Description: This file holds my results to project-1
        """
        ```
    - ***You should put this at the top of every file you write code in***
### External Packages
- âœ… In terminal, run `external.py` located in the `src` directory
    - This should fail due to lack of packages on your local machine
- âœ… In terminal, check your `python` and `pip` version. Copy and paste the result into `results.py`
- âœ… Using `pip`, download all the necessary outside packages specified in the `requirements.txt`
    - HINT: use the `-r` flag
- âœ… Retry running `external.py` to verify that your packages installed correctly
### Coding Exercises
- âœ… Complete `basic.py`, `intermediate.py`, and `advanced.py` located in the `aspire-py/Project-1/src/` directory
    - You should see sections of code that have a `TODO:` comment. Only write and modify code specified by these TODOs
    - When you are done, run the program from the terminal
        - ***MAKE SURE YOU RUN FROM `Project-1`***
    - If you completed all tests successfully, a secret message should print out. Copy it and add code in `results.py` that print it out

## Goals
After completing this project, you should be able to have the following skills:
- Understand what `fetch`, `merge` and `pull` do, and why they are necessary
- Basic understanding of modules, packages, and python package managers
- Get a good refresh on basic, intermediate, and advanced python programming techniques
    - variables
    - loops
    - conditionals
    - operators
    - Try-Catch
    - Classes and methods
    - Instantiation
    - Inheritance
    - Interfaces
    - Overriding
    - Decorators
    - attributes
    - static and class methods
